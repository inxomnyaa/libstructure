# libstructure

Implements the .mcstructure file format as virion for PocketMine-MP

## PalettedBlockArrayFilter

Implements methods to filter a PalettedBlockArray class by BlockStates or IDs. Since this class is technically not
directly related to the .mcstructure format it is planned to move this to a different project in the future.
